<br />
7. When you back out onto the list of tickets, you should see the first one with updated priorit and assignment.
-IF you select the open status it will remain in the quee. If you select resolved it will be grouped with closed tickets. If you click on a closed ticket you can review all the past edits made on the tickets and the responses between the end ussr’s and agents. *It is a good habit to look at the history of closed tickets IRL to get an idea of what problems seem to happen the most as well as which solutions seem to work best.*
</p>
<br />

You may repeat this process with multiple tickets and select different options for the status, priority, and SLA to see how it affects them.

You can also log in as an Agent and see how the permissions differ. Agents can see all of the tickets but they cannot edit them. If the ticket is not assigned to themt they cannot reply to the client either.
